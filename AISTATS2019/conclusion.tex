\section{Conclusion and Future Directions}

In this study, we proposed SWF, a theoretically grounded nonparametric algorithm for efficient implicit generative modeling. 
% Our approach is based on formulating the generative modeling problem as a functional optimization problem in the Wasserstein spaces, where the aim is to find a probability measure that is close to the data  distribution as much as possible while maintaining the expressiveness at a certain level. 
Our approach lies in the intersection of OT, Wasserstein gradient flows, and SDEs. This connection allowed us to convert the IGM problem to a non-linear SDE simulation problem. We provided finite-time error bounds for the infinite-particle regime and established explicit links between the algorithm parameters and the overall error. We believe that the proposed algorithm is the first nonparametric IGM algorithm with explicit theoretical guarantees. 
%
We conducted experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, where we showed that the results support our theory: SWF is able to generate samples from challenging distributions with low computational requirements. 

The SWF algorithm opens up interesting future directions: (i) extension of the algorithm to differentially private settings \cite{dwork2014algorithmic} by exploiting the fact that it only requires random projections of the data, (ii) showing the convergence scheme of the particle system \eqref{eqn:sde_particle} to the original SDE \eqref{eqn:sde}, (iii) providing error bounds directly for the particle scheme \eqref{eqn:euler_particle}, (iv) combining SWF with existing IGM approaches in order to be able to simulate the particles in a lower dimensional space.
