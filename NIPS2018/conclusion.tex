\section{Conclusion}

In this study, we proposed the Sliced-Wasserstein Flows, a nonparametric algorithm for implicit generative modeling. Our approach is based on formulating the generative modeling problem as a functional optimization problem in the Wasserstein spaces, where the aim is to find a probability measure that is close to the data  distribution as much as possible while maintaining the expressiveness at a certain level. Our approach lies in the intersection of OT, Wasserstein gradient flows, and SDEs. After establishing the  This connection allows us to approach the problem as a simulation of a non-linear SDE
