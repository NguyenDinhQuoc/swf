\begin{abstract}
By building up on the recent theory that established the connection between implicit generative modeling and optimal transport, in this study, we propose a novel parameter-free algorithm for learning the underlying distributions of complicated datasets and sampling from them. The proposed algorithm is based on a functional optimization problem, which aims at finding a measure that is close to the data distribution as much as possible and also expressive enough for generative modeling purposes. We formulate the problem as a gradient flow in the space of probability measures. The connections between gradient flows and stochastic differential equations let us develop a computationally efficient algorithm for solving the optimization problem, where the resulting algorithm resembles the recent dynamics-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms. We provide formal theoretical analysis where we prove finite-time error guarantees for the proposed algorithm. Our experimental results support our theory and shows that our algorithm is able to capture the structure of challenging distributions.
