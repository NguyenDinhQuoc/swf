\section{Experiments}

\begin{itemize}
\item Experiments on GMM
\begin{itemize}
\item We can focus on the 2D problem
\item Monitor the likelihood per iteration
\item We need to show the behavior and the additional contribution of the entropy -- repeat experiments for different level of the Gaussian noise
\end{itemize}
\item Experiments on real data
\begin{itemize}
\item The more the number of real datasets, the better
\item Experiments on emnist and Fashion mnist
\item We should illustrate the behavior of the level of the Gaussian noise
\end{itemize}
