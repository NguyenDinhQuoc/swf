\section{Conclusion and Future Directions}

In this study, we proposed SWF, an efficient, nonparametric IGM algorithm.
SWF is based on formulating IGM as a functional optimization problem in Wasserstein spaces, where the aim is to find a probability measure that is close to the data distribution as much as possible while maintaining the expressiveness at a certain level.
SWF lies in the intersection of OT, gradient flows, and SDEs, which allowed us to convert the IGM problem to an SDE simulation problem. We provided finite-time bounds for the infinite-particle regime and established explicit links between the algorithm parameters and the overall error.
%We believe that the proposed algorithm is the first nonparametric IGM algorithm with explicit theoretical guarantees.
%
We conducted several experiments, where we showed that the results support our theory: SWF is able to generate samples from non-trivial distributions with low computational requirements.

The SWF algorithm opens up interesting future directions: (i) extension to differentially private settings \cite{dwork2014algorithmic} by exploiting the fact that it only requires random projections of the data, (ii) showing the convergence scheme of the particle system \eqref{eqn:sde_particle} to the original SDE \eqref{eqn:sde}, (iii) providing bounds directly for the particle scheme \eqref{eqn:euler_particle}.
% (iv) combining SWF with existing IGM approaches in order to be able to simulate the particles in lower dimensional space.
